My personal website on the internet.

## Structure and design

* Minimalistic structure, just a static index.html, site.css and site.js

* [Semantic markup](https://html.com/semantic-markup/). For example, `<section>`, `<ul>` and `<article>`. This structures the page content semantically, allowing for improved accessibility with screen readers and improved search engine content parsing.

* Pure HTML and CSS. This allows more precise control over positioning and layout over a framework such as Bootstrap at the cost of not supporting legacy browsers.

* CSS naming convention: [BEM](http://getbem.com/)

* [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) for search engine indexing

* Vanilla JS utilising snippets from [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/)
