My personal website on the internet.

## Structure and design

* One index.html to rule them all. We don't need Jekyll where we're going (:

* Semantic markup! That's right! `<article>`s for articles and `<ul>`'s for lists, and other tags used as originally intended!

* CSS naming convention: [BEM](http://getbem.com/)

* [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) for search engine indexing
